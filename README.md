# Spark Premier # 

## Introduction ##
 
 This project contains practice exercises from my Spark training. Most of them where implemented in python (3.6) because bussiness issues (the company I work for is a Python shop).

## Datasets ##

I provided a convenience bas script (namely bin/download-data) to download all the datasets referenced by python scripts. Datasets are downloaded into src/datasets folder and they are fully documented in their respective readme.txt (or readme.md) files; more information about these datasets can be found in Alex Gude's [*The Nine Must-Have Datasets for Investigating Recommender Systems*](https://gab41.lab41.org/the-nine-must-have-datasets-for-investigating-recommender-systems-ce9421bf981c) article.
