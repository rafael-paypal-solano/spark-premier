# Spark Premier # 

## Introduction ##
 
 This project contains practice exercises from my Spark training. Most of them where implemented in python (3.6) because bussiness issues (the company I work for is a Python shop).

## Datasets ##

I provided a convenience bas script (namely bin/download-data) that downloads all the datasets references by python scripts.
